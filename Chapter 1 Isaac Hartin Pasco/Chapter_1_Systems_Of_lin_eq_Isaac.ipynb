    "Preamble: How to very basically use this. Cells are things you can type in and can be run. To run a cell you click on it with the left mouse button and then press shift and enter at the same time. In between Cells you should have a tooltip that appears if you hover your mouse there that says \"Code Text Paste Generate\". Code lets you type sage/python code and you run shift and enter to run it. Text lets you form a text box like this one that you can type $\\LaTeX$  and Markdown in pressing shift and enter in a text box formats it so it looks nice. Don't worry about the paste or generate boxes I don't know what they do. If you want to undo something control+z appears to do that. if you want to delete a cell go to edit in the top left next to file and go to delete cell. If you want to edit a cell you can double click it with the left mouse button. "

    "A note about variables in python specifically, NOT ABOUT VARIABLES IN THE EQUATION STUFF. A variable in python is a box that contains something. you tell python what kind of something you want you want to have a variable to hold using $\"Variable\" = \"something\"$. but without the quotes. You can set a variable to be the result of a mathematical expression for example $x = 2$ or $x = 2*2$  you use $+$ to add $-$ to subtract $/$ to divide $*$ to multiply and ^ to take something to a power. Note that this works with things that aren't numbers and depending on what they are, for example $x = \"hi\"+\"\\ there\"$ would make x be \"hi there\". you can also declare variables in terms of other variables and mathematical expressions with other variables assuming those variables already exist. Mathematical expressions obey order of operations and you can use parenthesis in them. One final thing. Code cells are evaluated from top to bottom and its a bad idea to do more than one equals sign per line. (the $==$ signifies two things actually being equal and you can have multiple of those just fine). "

    "Alright. Finally we can get to linear equations. A linear equation is an equation that can be represented in the form s0x0+s1x1+s2x2+...+snxn=ys0​x0​+s1​x1​+s2​x2​+...+sn​xn​=y where each of x0...xnx0​...xn​ is a variable and each of s0...sns0​...sn​ and yy is a scalar. these are very cool and useful for a lot of reasons that can be gotten into later. sage math and computer things make it so you can manipulate and solve them without having to brute force things and allows for generalizations and optimizations in the process of doing algebra that can be very useful. The sage documentation on linear algebra https://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/tutorial/tour_linalg.html is an excellent resource on this sort of thing."
